# ImageCompression-Using-PCA
We extend the idea of Eigen decomposition (Principal Component analysis) for compression of Image.

The learning outcomes from this project were:
1. Understand and use the image manipulation library within python,
2. Better understand the real world example on the use of Eigen Decomposition.
